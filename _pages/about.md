I am a 3rd-year master student in [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). 
I work in [DBGroup@SUSTech](https://dbgroup.sustech.edu.cn/) led by Prof. [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/).
Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2022.
I have interned at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/), [GaussDB Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/), [RS3Lab@EPFL](https://rs3lab.github.io/), and [Systems@TUDa](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systems/systems_tuda/index.en.jsp).

I am working on building **scalable systems for Data and ML**.
