I am a 2nd-year master student in [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). 
I work in [DBGroup@SUSTech](https://dbgroup.sustech.edu.cn/) led by Prof. [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/).
Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2022.

I am currently doing an internship in [RS3Lab@EPFL](https://rs3lab.github.io/) about LLM systems. I have interned at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/) and [GaussDB Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/) before.

I am working on building **scalable systems for data management**. 
In particular, I am interested in databases on modern hardware, cloud-native databases, blockchains, and vector databases.
