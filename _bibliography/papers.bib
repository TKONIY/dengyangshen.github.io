abstract = {As a popular distributed data warehouse system, Apache Hive has been widely used for big data analytics in many organizations. Meanwhile, exploiting the massive parallelism of GPU to accelerate online analytical processing (OLAP) has been extensively explored in the database community. In this paper, we present GHive, which enhances CPU-based Hive via CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing. GHive is designed for the business intelligence applications and provides the same API as Hive for compatibility. To run SQL queries jointly on both CPU and GPU, GHive comes with three key techniques: (i) a novel data model gTable, which is column-based and enables efficient data movement between CPU memory and GPU memory; (ii) a GPU-based operator library Panda, which provides a complete set of SQL operators with extensively optimized GPU implementations; (iii) a hardware-aware MapReduce job placement scheme, which puts jobs judiciously on either GPU or CPU via a cost-based approach. In the experiments, we observe that GHive outperforms Hive in both query processing speed and operating expense on the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB).},

abstract = {As a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system for large-scale data analytics, Apache Hive has been used for various applications in many organizations (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, and Huawei). Exploiting the large degrees of parallelism of GPU to improve the performance of online analytical processing (OLAP) in database system is a common practice in the industry. Meanwhile, it is a common practice to exploit the large degrees of parallelism of GPU to improve the performance of online analytical processing (OLAP) in database systems. This demo presents GHive, which enables Apache Hive to accelerate OLAP queries by jointly utilizing CPU and GPU in intelligent and efficient ways. The takeaways for SIGMOD attendees include: (1) the superior performance of GHive compared with vanilla Hive that only uses CPU; (2) intuitive visualizations of execution statistics for Hive and GHive to understand where the acceleration of GHive comes from; (3) detailed profiling of the time taken by each operator on CPU and GPU to show the advantages of GPU execution.},
